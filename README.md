# AuthEC - ASP.NET Web API

This project is a Web API built using **.NET 8**. It incorporates modern best practices and features, including:

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to API endpoints.
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Supports `Admin`, `Teacher`, and `Student` roles.
- **MS SQL Server**: A robust database backend for application data.
- **N-Tier Architecture**: A structured design for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Custom Authorization Policies**: Enables fine-grained access control beyond roles.
- **Email Confirmation Logic**: Verifies user email addresses before allowing sign-in.

## Features

### 1. JWT Authentication
- Ensures secure API access with JSON Web Tokens.
- Tokens are issued after successful login and are required for accessing secured endpoints.

### 2. Role-Based Authentication
- Supports the following roles:
  - `Admin`: Has full access to manage the application.
  - `Teacher`: Can access and manage resources specific to teachers.
  - `Student`: Has access to student-specific resources.
- Role-based access control is implemented using `[Authorize(Roles = "RoleName")]`.

### 3. MS SQL Server
- The project uses Microsoft SQL Server for data storage and management.
- Database connection is configured in `appsettings.json`.

### 4. N-Tier Architecture
- **Presentation Layer**: API controllers to handle HTTP requests.
- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Contains application-specific logic.
- **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Manages database operations.
- Provides clear separation of concerns for easier maintenance and scalability.

### 5. Custom Authorization Policies
- Adds fine-grained access control based on custom business logic or user attributes.
- Policies are defined in the `Policies` directory and applied to endpoints using `[Authorize(Policy = "PolicyName")]`.

### 6. Email Confirmation Logic
- Before signing in, users must confirm their email address.
- A confirmation email containing a unique verification link is sent during registration.
- The API endpoint validates the email and code from the confirmation link.

## Corresponding Frontend

This project is designed to work seamlessly with its corresponding frontend application built in Angular. The frontend repository can be found here:

ðŸ‘‰ [Auth-EC-FE-Angular Frontend](https://github.com/e19465/Auth-EC-FE-Angular)

The frontend handles user interactions and communicates with this API for operations like authentication, email confirmation, and role-based access control.
